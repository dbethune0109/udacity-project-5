Neighborhood Map Application

This application is the 5 th project for Udacity using Knockout, Jquery, HTML, CSS, googlemaps.api, foursquare.api.
It uses Google Maps with markers to locate some of my favorite places and uses foursquare to give ratings.


Motivation

The JavaScript section of the course utilizes api calls and how to integrate them into web apps.
